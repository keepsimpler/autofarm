The PlantVillage dataset is a collection of 54,305 images of 14 different plant species, belonging to 38 classes, 12 of which are healthy, 26 of which are diseased.

The dataset was created by the Penn State College of Agricultural Sciences and the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture as a resource for research and development of computer vision-based plant disease detection systems.
The images in the dataset were collected from various sources, including research institutions and citizen scientists, and represent a wide variety of plant species and disease types.
